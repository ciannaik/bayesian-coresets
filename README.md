# Bayesian Coresets: automated, scalable Bayesian inference

This repository contains the main package used to run the experiments for [Automated, Scalable Bayesian Inference with Theoretical Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05053)
and [Bayesian Coreset Construction via Greedy Iterative Geodesic Ascent](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05053). 
More details will be added soon. 

Note: this package is written for Python2.7, and is untested for Python3. The package will be updated to be Python3 compatible shortly.
